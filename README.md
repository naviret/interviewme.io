# interviewme.io

## Inspiration

Our inspiration for interviewme.io stems from a passion to empower individuals in their technical interview journey. As a student recruiting for software engineering roles, I have really benefitted from mock interview practice sessions. However, mock interviews aren't accessible and require either some friends who agree to interview you, or paying obscene amounts of money for a single interview. For instance, mock interviews in some competitors start at $150 per interview and go up to $500. Our goal for this project was to democratize the technical interview practice space by making it accessible and incentivizing users with crypto rewards.

## What it does

Although interviewme.io is still in development, it is a dynamic platform that provides users with an immersive experience in technical interview preparation. Through coding challenges in a real-time interview setting, users can fine-tune the skills required to successfully solve and explain a programming question to their interviewer. What sets this platform apart is the integration of a platform token, creating a tokenized ecosystem that rewards users for time spent interviewing and the feedback they received, adding an exciting dimension to their learning journey as well as an incentive for other users to join. Note that we plan for users to be able to act as both interviewees or interviewers, since both can be highly educational.

## How we built it

This weekend, we spent most of our time planning how the platform would work/what stack it would use. We settled on using a hybrid web2/web3 architecture with a Javascript and React frontend, with and Node backend. We are working on using the new Google Meets API to host online meetings for our users to interview, as well as to track meeting length. The Google Meets API allows for seamless access to query meeting information, like meeting length. This information will then be stored in a decentralized peer-to-peer database. This weekend, focused on building a wireframe for our what our platform could look like, plus planning out the platform token.

## Challenges we ran into

While developing Interviewme.io, we encountered several challenges, especially in figuring out what kind of the token we wanted to develop and how to combine a web2 and web3 architecture. The main concern was whether we should cap the coin's supply or not. As of now the token is uncapped to allow for user's progression in the platform, always incentivizing user's to keep engaging. This means that the token is minted as the user progresses. However, minting strategy depends on how many tokens are in circulation and how much they are worth, similar to how Bitcoin halves its tokens every 4 years. Making these decisions required breaking down what makes successful crypto coins and tokens and this showcased our team's resilience and problem-solving skills.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We take pride in achieving a plan for our a platform token and what our platform will look like. These accomplishments underscore our commitment to delivering a high-quality platform that meets the diverse needs of our users.

## What we learned

Throughout the development of Interviewme.io, we gained valuable insights into what web3 applications generally consist of, as well as an overview of tokenomics. These lessons have enriched our understanding of what underlies a web3app, speeding up our development of similar projects in the future, along with what makes web3 apps successful.

## What's next for Interviewme.io

Looking ahead, we envision a more robust development of the platform, especially in the frontend and backend. Our roadmap includes deployment-ready frontend, adding user authorization with Hedera, and deploying a token in a real network as opposed to a test network. We are excited about the potential that this platform has for revolutionizing how students mock interview, and we invite the community to join us on this transformative journey.
